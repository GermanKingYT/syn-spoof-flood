= Introduction

It's a simple script that to do ddos attack (syn flood) and it also use ip spoof technique. Every package that it send go with a different ip address.

I did it just to proof of concept about a paper work at university. To demonstrate two attack techniques.

Don't use it to do bad things. Just to learn about security.

It is an old script, I did it in 2008/2009.
